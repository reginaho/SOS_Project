# SOS_Project

This software introduces an engaging digital version of the SOS game, featuring a dynamic face-off between a blue player and a red player. In this interactive game, each participant, who can be either a human or a computer, competes on a grid board sized n√ón, where n is greater than 2. 
Players alternate turns, placing either an "S" or an "O" on any vacant square, without being bound to repeat the same letter. The core objective is to form the sequence S-O-S, which can be aligned diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
The game enhances the experience by marking each successfully formed SOS sequence with a line in the respective player's color, blue or red, making it easy to track the progress and contributions of each player
